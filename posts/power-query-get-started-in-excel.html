    <p>There is a feature in Excel called Power Query. Personally, I think this is one
if the best feature in Excel. Despite this, I find that very few people are
aware of it. It is a wonderful when you are analyzing data.</p>

<p>With Power Query you could easily combine and modify data automatically. If you
know how to create SQL queries, this is something like that. But the data does
not have to be in database server, you could combine data from Excel-files,
CSV-files, webpages and mix it up in any why you like.</p>

<p>Power Query is not only used in Excel, it is also a fundamental part of PowerBI
and could also be found in Azure Data Factory.</p>

<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>

<p>When you are working with Power Query, you need to have some data. The data
could come from various sources, like a web server, a database server, a file
etc. Tables in Excel works too, and we start with this because it is very
simple. Copy this table into Excel:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><strong>PlayerID</strong></th>
      <th><strong>First name</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Last name</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Birth date</strong></th>
      <th><strong>Country code</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Alice</td>
      <td>Aliceson</td>
      <td>1971-01-01</td>
      <td>SE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Bob</td>
      <td>Bobsson</td>
      <td>1972-02-02</td>
      <td>NO</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Carol</td>
      <td>Carlsson</td>
      <td>1973-03-03</td>
      <td>SE</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4</td>
      <td>David</td>
      <td>Davidsson</td>
      <td>1974-04-04</td>
      <td>NO</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>Eric</td>
      <td>Ericsson</td>
      <td>1975-05-05</td>
      <td>DK</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>6</td>
      <td>Frank</td>
      <td>Franksson</td>
      <td>1976-06-06</td>
      <td>FI</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>Georg</td>
      <td>Georgsson</td>
      <td>1977-07-07</td>
      <td>NO</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>8</td>
      <td>Henrik</td>
      <td>Henriksson</td>
      <td>1978-08-08</td>
      <td>SE</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Select the table, and then select <strong>Data</strong> and then <strong>From Table/Range</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/0016/excel_menu_data_fromtable.png" alt="Data &gt; From Table/Range" title="Data &gt; From Table/Range" /></p>

<p>If you are being asked to create a table, just click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p>Next you will get a new window that look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/0016/editor_first_view.png" alt="Editor" title="Editor" /></p>

<p>There is a lot of things in here, so it is easy to get a bit intimidated by this
at first. This is the Power Query Editor and hopefully you will soon be
comfortable with this :-) For now, we will keep it as simple as possible. In
<strong>Properties</strong> &gt; <strong>Name</strong> enter <strong>Player</strong>. This is the name of this data query.
When you are working with several queries, it helps if they have good names.</p>

<p>Next, click on <strong>Close &amp; Load</strong> in the upper left corner. After that, Excel will
look like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/0016/excel_query_player.png" alt="Player Query Result" title="Player Query Result" /></p>

<p>As you see, you now have two sheets. In <strong>Sheet1</strong> you have your original data,
in <strong>Sheet2</strong> you have this green table. They look pretty much the same, so what
is the point of this?</p>

<p>Data queries will just end up as virtual a table with data. This is just pure
data; it does not have any colors or even a look. What you see in <strong>Sheet2</strong> is
just a representation of this data. This sounds a bit abstract at first, but it
is a useful concept. There will be cases where you just want to have data but
does not want to show it.</p>

<p>Now remove <strong>Sheet2</strong> from your spread sheet. Is all the work we have done now
in Power Query now removed? No, it is still in there, you just cannot see it. In
the right side in Excel you see the panel <strong>Queries &amp; Connections</strong> (if you do
not see it, click on <strong>Data</strong> &gt; <strong>Queries &amp; Connections</strong>).</p>

<p>In this panel, you see all your queries. For now, there is only one named
<strong>Player</strong>. You could (but do not do it now) double click on this to open the
Power Query editor again. But instead, right click on <strong>Player</strong> and select
<strong>Load To…</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/0016/query_player_loadto.png" alt="Load To" title="Load To" /></p>

<p>We are doing this because we want to see that data again. Now you get questions
on how this should be visualized, select <strong>Table</strong> &gt; <strong>New worksheet</strong> and make
sure <strong>New worksheet</strong> is selected. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/0016/import_data_table.png" alt="Import data as table" title="Import data as table" /></p>

<p>Now you should see your data again in a new green table. This way you could
easily visualize your data if you need to.</p>

<h2 id="refreshing-data">Refreshing data</h2>

<p>Now, go back to your original data on <strong>Sheet1.</strong> Change a name of the player,
then go back to the sheet where you visualize the data. As you see, the old name
is still shown. Oh, so upsetting!</p>

<p>The reason for this is that Excel does not automatically update your data
queries when you are editing a cell. This is a difference compared to ordinary
formulas. Instead we need to instruct Excel to refresh the data.</p>

<p>There are two ways to do this. If you just have one query you want to refresh,
in the <strong>Queries &amp; Connections</strong> panel you could just click on the <strong>Refresh</strong>
button.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/0016/query_player_refresh.png" alt="Refresh query" title="Refresh query" /></p>

<p>Another options, is to use <strong>Data</strong> &gt; <strong>Refresh all</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/0016/excel_menu_data_refreshall.png" alt="Refresh all" title="Refresh all" /></p>

<p>This especially useful if you want to refresh several queries. Use any of these
options and you will see that you now have the same data on both sheets.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>You can check the final result of this part in this file: 
<a href="/assets/files/0016/power-query-part-1.xlsx">power-query-part-1.xlsx</a>.</p>

<p>In this tutorial you have learned how to create a query from a table in Excel.
You have also learned how to visualize this query in Excel.</p>

<p>But still, you probably still wondering what the point of all this is. Where is
the power? It will be more interesting when we will look deeper into the Power
Query editor in the next part: <a href="/posts/power-query-working-with-columns">Power Query - Working with columns</a>.</p>
