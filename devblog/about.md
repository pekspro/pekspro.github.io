I started this simple blog just to have a place to store all the interesting
problems and solutions regarding a run into while I am doing software
development. I hope you find something useful in here.

This site is hosted [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/), and is build by
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Actions. If you have any question or
feedback, post them in the [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/pekspro/pekspro.github.io). There you will find
the complete code of the blog. Feel free to clone it if you want to use it as a
base for you own blog.
