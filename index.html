            Power Query - Joining data

        </h3><p>Sometime useful to combine data from two tables when you are working with Excel.
You could do this with functions like VLOOKUP. It works, but it is a pain to
use. If you instead are using Power Query, you could easily join data from two
tables. If you know SQL, you will find this familiar.</p>
